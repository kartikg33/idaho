    <h3><code>IDAHO</code> is a user-friendly evolution of <code>RACI</code> with sharper roles &amp; responsibilities and a more intuitive workflow.</h3>

### What's wrong with `RACI`?

`RACI` (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is the go-to framework for clarifying project roles. The theory is sound, but in practice it often creates **confusion instead of clarity**.

The greatest problem is that **most people struggle to explain the difference between "Responsible" and "Accountable"**. And that creates friction before the work has even started. 

Here are some common pain points of `RACI`:
- **Unclear language** → "Responsible" vs. "Accountable" is too similar.  
- **Decision blind spots** → RACI doesn’t clearly identify who actually decides.  
- **Overlapping roles** → People often end up in multiple categories without clarity.  
- **Difficult adoption** → The jargon feels abstract and unintuitive outside project management.

### How does `IDAHO` clear the confusion?

`IDAHO` builds on the strengths of `RACI` but redefines the roles in **plain language** that aligns with **modern workplace responsibilities**:

<div align="center">
<h4><code>Implementer</code></h4>
<h4><code>Decision-Maker</code></h4>
<h4><code>Advisor</code></h4>
<h4><code>Helper</code></h4>
<h4><code>Observer</code></h4>
</div>

#### Why does this work better?

- **Plain Language** → Everyone instantly understands the roles.  
- **Decision-first Framing** → Centers accountability on *who makes the decisions*.  
- **Adds flexibility** → Helpers acknowledge the floating contributors that RACI ignores.  
- **Evolution, not Replacement** → Builds on the foundations of `RACI` but fixes its pitfalls.

### How does this compare to `RACI`?

| Old `RACI` keyword | New `IDAHO` keyword | Role & Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Responsible** | **Implementer** | The doer(s). Executes the work. No confusion with accountability. |
| **Accountable** | **Decision-Maker** | Owns the outcome and makes the final decision.<br>*NOTE: There should only ever be **one** Decision-Maker at any given time.* |
| **Consulted** | **Advisor** | Provides input and expertise before a decision is made. Influence without authority. |
| **—** | **Helper** | A new category: someone who floats in/out as needed to push the project along (e.g. project managers, asset creators, slide designers). |
| **Informed** | **Observer** | Stays in the loop. Updated but not involved in decisions or execution. |

The result: **no overlap, no jargon, no confusion.**

## `IDAHO` roles in detail

1. **Implementer** (was *Responsible*)  
   - Executes the work.  
   - There may be multiple Implementers.  

2. **Decision-Maker** (was *Accountable*)  
   - Owns the decision and its outcome.  
   - Has final authority.  
   - **Rule:** there must only be **one Decision-Maker per task, project, or deliverable.**  

3. **Advisor** (was *Consulted*)  
   - Provides input, expertise, or feedback.  
   - Has influence before a decision is made, but not the final say.  

4. **Helper** (new)  
   - Not fully committed to the project, but provides support when needed.  
   - Floats in and out to keep things moving (e.g. project managers, asset generation, PowerPoint support).  
   - Acts as a catalyst, not a core owner.  

5. **Observer** (was *Informed*)  
   - Stays in the loop.  
   - Receives updates after decisions or during execution.  
   - No influence on the decision.

## Rules to note

- **Only one Decision-Maker at any time** — ultimate accountability is never shared.  
- **Multiple Implementers allowed** — execution can be distributed.  
- **Advisors** give input *before* decisions, but don’t decide themselves.  
- **Helpers** support the project intermittently but are not core owners.  
- **Observers** are updated *after* decisions or milestones.

### What's wrong with `RACI`?

`RACI` (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is the go-to framework for clarifying project roles. The theory is sound, but in practice it often creates **confusion instead of clarity**.

The greatest problem is that **most people struggle to explain the difference between "Responsible" and "Accountable"**. And that creates friction before the work has even started. 

Here are some common pain points of `RACI`:
- **Unclear language** → "Responsible" vs. "Accountable" is too similar.  
- **Decision blind spots** → RACI doesn’t clearly identify who actually decides.  
- **Difficult adoption** → The jargon feels abstract and unintuitive outside project management.  


### How does `OADI` clear the confusion?
`OADI` builds on the strengths of `RACI` but redefines the roles in `plain language` that aligns with `modern workplace roles & responsibilities`:

<div align="center">
<h5>Observer</h5>
<h5>Advisor</h5>
<h5>Decision-Maker</h5>
<h5>Implementer</h5>
</div>

#### Why does this work better?

- **Plain Language** → Everyone instantly understands the roles.  
- **Decision-first Framing** → Centers accountability on *who makes the decisions*.  
- **Evolution, not Replacement** → Builds on the foundations of `RACI` but fixes its pitfalls.  

#### How does this compare to `RACI`?

| Old `RACI` keyword | New `OADI` keyword | Role & Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Responsible** | **Implementer** | Removes the confusion with "Accountable". And Implementer is someone who does the actual work. 
| **Accountable** | **Decision Maker** | Removes the confusion with "Responsible". No more trying to figure out what "owner" means. The Decision Maker is the one who makes the final decision. It's as easy as that.<br>*NOTE: There should only ever be **one** decision maker at any given time.*
| **Consulted** | **Advisor** | Role stays the same. In simpler language, the Advisor provides advice.
| **Informed** | **Observer** | Role stays the same. In simpler language, the Observer observes the project but is not involved in implementing, decision-making, or advising.

The result: **no overlap, no jargon, no confusion.**

## `OADI` roles in detail

1. **Observer** (was *Informed*)  
   - Stays in the loop.  
   - Receives updates after decisions or during execution.  
   - No influence on the decision.  

2. **Advisor** (was *Consulted*)  
   - Provides input, expertise, or feedback.
   - Has influence before a decision is made, but not the final say.  

3. **Decision-Maker** (was *Accountable*)  
   - Owns the decision and its outcome.  
   - Has final authority.  
   - **Rule:** there must only be **one Decision-Maker per task, project, or deliverable.**  

4. **Implementer** (was *Responsible*)  
   - Executes the work.  
   - There may be multiple Implementers.  
   - In some cases, the Decision-Maker and Implementer may be the same person (**Decision-Making-Implementer**).  

## Rules to note

- **Only one Decision-Maker at any time** — ultimate accountability is never shared.  
- **Multiple Implementers allowed** — execution can be distributed.  
- **Decision-Making-Implementer** is valid when the same person/group is responsible for making decisions *and* doing the work.  
- **Advisors** give input *before* decisions, but can't decide anything themselves.  
- **Observers** are updated *after* decisions or milestones have been made. No input expected.
